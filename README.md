ðŸš— SQL Vehicle Inventory Project
This project showcases my SQL skills using PostgreSQL to analyze vehicle inventory data. I performed data cleaning, uploading, and querying to extract insights about electric vehicles, Hyundai counts per city, and utilized SQL joins.

ðŸ“Œ Table Creation
I created the table in PostgreSQL with relevant columns for vehicle data.

ðŸ“¥ Uploading Data
I imported the dataset into PostgreSQL using the COPY command.![Screenshot 2025-02-27 193917](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8588fd7c-3494-40e7-801d-cd9832069899)

ðŸ”— Inner Join Example
To enrich the dataset, I performed an INNER JOIN with another table.
